### Phase 13: Modular Plan Generation (Future Work)

**Goal:** Achieve strict 1-to-1 graph equivalence between launch file tree and plan file tree

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (Design complete - see launch2plan.md)

**Problem Statement:** Current implementation (Phases 1-8) generates a single monolithic plan file with all included content inlined. This does NOT achieve graph equivalence with the launch file structure.

**Core Principle:** **One launch file â†’ one plan file** (regardless of how many times included or with what arguments)

**Architecture Changes:**

Transform from:
```
launch2plan convert robot.launch.py
â†’ robot.plan.yaml (single file, all content inlined)
```

To:
```
launch2plan convert robot.launch.py --output-dir output/
â†’ output/robot.plan.yaml           (parent with include references)
â†’ output/sensors/camera.plan.yaml  (separate file, accepts arguments)
â†’ output/nav2_bringup/launch/navigation.plan.yaml  (package-based)
â†’ output/_path/home/user/custom/special.plan.yaml  (path-based)
```

**Work Items:**

1. **F73: Multi-File Output Infrastructure** (6 hours)
2. **F74: Package Detection** (4 hours)
3. **F75: Include References (Not Inlining)** (5 hours)
4. **F76: Argument Substitution Generation** (4 hours)
5. **F77: Deduplication by File Path** (3 hours)
6. **F78: Output Directory Management** (3 hours)

**Test Count:** ~30 new tests

**Deliverable:** Modular plan generation with strict 1-to-1 graph equivalence to launch file structure
