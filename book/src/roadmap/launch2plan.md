### Phase 9: Modular Plan Generation (Refactor)

**Goal:** Achieve strict 1-to-1 graph equivalence between launch file tree and plan file tree

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (Design complete)

**Problem Statement:** Current implementation (Phases 1-8) generates a single monolithic plan file with all included content inlined. This does NOT achieve graph equivalence with the launch file structure.

**Architecture Changes:**

Transform from:
```
launch2plan convert robot.launch.py
â†’ robot.plan.yaml (single file, all content inlined)
```

To:
```
launch2plan convert robot.launch.py --output-dir output/
â†’ output/robot.plan.yaml           (parent with include references)
â†’ output/sensors/camera.plan.yaml  (separate file, accepts arguments)
â†’ output/nav2_bringup/launch/navigation.plan.yaml  (package-based)
â†’ output/_path/home/user/custom/special.plan.yaml  (path-based)
```
